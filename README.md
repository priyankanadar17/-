Summary: This project is being implemented in multisim software with the help of components like 555 timer,4017 decade counter and other simple components.
Drawback:The main limitation is,we cannot set an accurate delay in simulation like in real life model,but we can set delay approximately  by changing the values of resistance and capacitance since both are directly proportional to delay.
Formula: Ï„=1.1R.C
Future scope:This project gives us a basic idea about how traffic signals actually work.We can make  further changes  according to our requirement by interfacing it with more user-friendly and advanced software.
